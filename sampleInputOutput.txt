BANG "Damn!"
Your car broke down. In the middle of a forest.
"I'm sorry Hest, but it looks like we have to find a place to stay for the night"
Furrowing your eyebrows, you reluctantly agreed. What a great way to start your anniversary trip. But what could you do?
You hopped off the car, squinting your eyes, hoping to find a residence in the dense forest.

"There!" Asher exclaimed, "I told you, a house!"
Under the dim lights of the silver moon, the house seems perfect for the setting of a murder mystery.
A chill was sent down your spine. You were hesitant to step inside.
"Let fate decide for us." You mumbled.
You roll the dice you have been holding to determine your action (>=3):  (type dice to roll)

You rolled a 4
Though sceptical, you had to seek shelter before you two froze to death.

You found a piece of paper laying on the floor.
It is an old black and white newspaper clipping bearing the heading
"Miracle! The Only Survivor In the Burning House"
There is a photo of a girl covered in flames yet standing straight, glaring straight at the camera.
Oddly enough, you feel a connection with the house and those pair of amber eyes.

You are curious why is it here.

You rolled a 5

You've decided to ask Asher if he knows anything.
Carefully putting the newspaper in your pocket, you muster up the courage to ask Asher about this news.
He shakes his head vigorously and urge me to move on.
It's odd how he reacted.

It seems like an ordinary diary.  What bothers you most is that the last pages of the book is burned and written

The newspaper. The fireplace. The empty knife holder and the instructions. The Kit chocolate. The diary.

It all links up now.

You can feel the fury kindling within you. The love you once had for Asher now becomes pure hatred, so pure it is the perfect fuel for your growing desire. You desire to burn this house AND this man into ashes.

Cold.
You woke up. Cold.
You are surrounded by darkness. Cold.
You shuffle around, desperately finding warmth and light.
As you walk around, you stepped on something small. Something...cubic.
You picked up the item, rubbing your sore foot.
Engravings of dots. This must be the dice that Hestia keeps fidgeting.

You rolled a 5

You look around. "Hest?", you shout.
No response.
"Hestia!" you scream out her name.

Returning your devastating call is a burst of red flames at the door.
You rush to the flames, reaching out your hand to the warmth--
Flames touch the tips of your fingers.
It feels fuzzy and nostalgic, feels like hearth and hestiaThe fire slowly spread to palms, crawing up your arms, scorching your body.
It getting too hot. You can feel  Hestia's fury.
Before long, you are completelt engulfed in flames.
You can clearly feel Hestia's wrath through the burning pain on your skin.
Hestia, standing at door.
Her amber eyes reflecting the flickering flames, his pathetic begging figure being the centrepiece.
She smiles and leaves, the door closing behind her, closing the fate of the man who betrayed her.
. . .
Ashes fills the air, spiralling lavishly under the dawning sun.
Flames furiously flickering, dancing atrociously until the forest regained its silence.
The end.
